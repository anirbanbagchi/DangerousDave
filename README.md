# 🚀 DangerousDave

**DangerousDave** is a personal playground and experimental repository for building, testing, and showcasing **cool, practical, and occasionally dangerous ideas** across data engineering, automation, analytics, and tooling.

This repo is intentionally flexible: it can host **proof-of-concepts, utilities, experiments, and reusable components** that don’t yet warrant their own standalone repositories.

---

## 📌 Purpose & Philosophy

The goal of **DangerousDave** is to:

- Experiment fast without over-engineering
- Capture useful patterns before they’re forgotten
- Build things that are *practically useful*, not just theoretically interesting
- Maintain **clean structure**, **clear documentation**, and **reproducibility**

> If it’s clever, useful, or just fun-but not production-ready yet-it belongs here.

## 🧠 What Lives in This Repo

This repository may include (but is not limited to):

- 🔧 **Automation scripts** (Python, Bash, Zsh, etc.)
- 📊 **Data engineering utilities** (ETL helpers, Spark snippets, SQL patterns)
- ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps experiments** (AWS, Databricks, CI/CD ideas)
- 🤖 **AI & LLM prototypes** (prompting, agents, evaluations)
- 🧪 **Proofs of concept** and exploratory code
- 📝 **Notes & references** worth preserving

Each project or experiment should live in its **own clearly named folder**.
